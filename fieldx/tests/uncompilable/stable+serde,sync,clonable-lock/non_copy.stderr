error[E0277]: the trait bound `String: Copy` is not satisfied
 --> tests/uncompilable/non_copy.rs
  |
  |     foo: String,
  |          ^^^^^^ the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `String`
  |
note: required by a bound in `__field_implements_copy`
 --> tests/uncompilable/non_copy.rs
  |
  | #[fxstruct]
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `__field_implements_copy`
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `fxstruct` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.foo` which is behind a shared reference
 --> tests/uncompilable/non_copy.rs
  |
  |       #[fieldx(copy, get, clearer)]
  |  ____________________^
  | |     foo: String,
  | |_______^ move occurs because `self.foo` has type `Option<String>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable

6 |     foo.clone(): String,
