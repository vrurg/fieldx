  = note: for local types consider adding `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]` to your `Foo` type
  = note: for types from other crates check whether the crate offers a `serde` feature flag
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Serialize`:
            bool
            char
            isize
            i8
            i16
            i32
            i64
            i128
          and $N others
