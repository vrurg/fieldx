# Coercion

This section discusses Rust's [`Into`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html) trait, which facilitates type conversion. FieldX supports this trait through the `{{i:into}}` argument, enabling automatic conversion of a value into the field type when setting its value:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/book_into.rs:into_decl}}

{{#include ../../../examples/book_into.rs:into_usage}}
```

Compare this to the example from the [Setters](setters.md) section:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/book_setter.rs:set_location}}
```

Although, for better readability, a method from another trait – [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) – is used, the concept remains the same: the `into` argument allows you to set a field value using a type that implements the `Into` trait for the field type. Since `&str` implements `Into<String>`, one could replace the `to_string()` method call with the `into()` method interchangeably, preserving the semantics of the code.

Finally, why is this section titled "Coercion"? The intent is to highlight the distinction between the explicit use of the `Into` trait by manually invoking the `into()` method and the implicit coercion performed within the methods generated by FieldX for you.
