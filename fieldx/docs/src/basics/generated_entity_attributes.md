# Generated Entity Attributes

At a times there might be a need to annotate the entities, generated by FieldX, with additional attributes. Say, to silence down check warnings (`#[allow(dead_code)]`), derive additional traits, or even use some home brew procedural macros. To do so FieldX provides three arguments:

- `attributes` - for generated structs
- `attributes_fn` - for generated methods
- `attributes_impl` - for generated implementations

Say, I've got a crazy idea of having my builder type clonable. Voila!

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/book_attributes.rs:attr_decl}}

{{#include ../../../examples/book_attributes.rs:attr_usage}}
```

Not all arguments that support this feature support all three sub-arguments though. For example, the helper arguments only know about the `attributes_fn` since they work with methods. It is better to consule with the technical documentation of [the `fxstruct` macro](https://docs.rs/fieldx/latest/fieldx/attr.fxstruct.html).
