# Lazy Field Initialization

This section introduces {{i:lazy field initialization}} for those unfamiliar with the concept. If you're already familiar, feel free to skip ahead.

Consider a struct that interacts with a network resource. Suppose there is a block of data you need to retrieve from the resource and use throughout the struct's implementation or elsewhere. Retrieving this data is relatively expensive, and you might not need it immediately—or at all—depending on the context. A beginner might instinctively retrieve the data in the struct's constructor and store it in a field. However, this approach has a significant drawback: the object's construction time becomes dependent on the time it takes to retrieve the data, which might never be used.

The lazy initialization pattern addresses this issue by deferring the data retrieval until it is actually needed. Here's an example in pseudo-code:

```rust ignore
struct NetworkResource {
    data: Option<DataType>,
}

impl NetworkResource {
    /// Accessor method to get the data.
    fn data(&mut self) -> &DataType {
        if self.data.is_none() {
            self.data = Some(self.pull_data());
        }
        self.data.as_ref().unwrap()
    }

    fn pull_data(&self) -> DataType {
        // Pull the data from the network resource
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `data()` accessor retrieves the value only when the method gets called. If it is never called, the data is never pulled.

Now, consider a more complex scenario where the exact locator for the data is stored elsewhere on the resource. In this case, we need something like the following:

```rust ignore
struct NetworkResource {
    data: Option<DataType>,
    location_directory: Option<LocationDirectory>,
}

impl NetworkResource {
    /// Accessor method to get the location directory.
    fn location_directory(&mut self) -> &LocationDirectory {
        if self.location_directory.is_none() {
            self.location_directory = Some(self.pull_location_directory());
        }
        self.location_directory.as_ref().unwrap()
    }

    /// Accessor method to get the data.
    fn data(&mut self, location: &str) -> &DataType {
        if self.data.is_none() {
            self.data = Some(self.pull_data(location));
        }
        self.data.as_ref().unwrap()
    }

    fn pull_data(&self, location: &str) -> DataType {
        // Pull the data from the network resource using the location
        let locator = self.location_directory().get_data_location();
        // Use the locator to pull the data
    }

    fn pull_location_directory(&self) -> LocationDirectory {
        // Pull the location directory from the network resource
    }
}
```

In this example, the `data()` method implicitly depends on the `location_directory()` method, but this dependency is hidden from the API. The user code remains agnostic about it.

Now, imagine a scenario where the dependency chain becomes more complex. The data retrieval might depend on user decisions, the current state of the resource, or other factors. Ultimately, the data you retrieve could depend on a combination of these factors, and the path to access it might be intricate. The implicit dependency hides these complexities from the user code, providing a simple API to access the desired value.

This concept is analogous to what a {{i:dependency manager}} does in [{{i:dependency injection}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) frameworks.

For a deeper dive into the lazy initialization pattern, you can refer to the [Lazy Initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization) article on Wikipedia. While the article provides a solid overview, it does not delve into advanced topics such as handling concurrent access patterns, which are crucial in multi-threaded environments.
