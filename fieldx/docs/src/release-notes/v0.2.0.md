# v0.2.0

This release marks the first stable version of `fieldx`, summarizing over a year of development based on experience gained from using FieldX in various work and personal projects. The stabilization of features ensures that:

- All patch versions v0.2.x will maintain backwards compatibility.
- The crate is ready for widespread public use.
- The release can now be bundled with this book, which aims to provide a comprehensive guide on using `fieldx` in your projects.

With this release two utility crates are also considered ready for public use, though not yet fully documented:

- [`fieldx_aux`](https://docs.rs/fieldx_aux/latest/fieldx_aux/)
- [`fieldx_core`](https://docs.rs/fieldx_core/latest/fieldx_core/)

These modules are designed to help extending FieldX with 3rd-party crates by exposing crate's internal structures and APIs. Basically, FieldX itself is built upon these two.
